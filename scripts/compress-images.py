# ------- üëã Welcome to the script for compressing images ------- #
# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - #
# The purpose of this script is to compress images that are       #
# larger than 900KB.                                              #

# To use the script, ensure that the `moonbeam-docs` repo is      #
# nestled inside of the `moonbeam-mkdocs` repo. Then simply run   #
# `python scripts/compress-images.py` in your terminal. The       #
# script will check all of the images to see the current size and #
# if any are larger than 900KB, it will use the Tinify library to #
# compress the images. Tinify compresses images by selectively    #
# decreasing the number of colors in the image so fewer bytes are #
# required to store the data. To use the Tinify library, you will #
# need an API key. Check LastPass or create your own using the    #
# link below. Once compression is done, you will see that the     #
# original image has been renamed to "uncompressed" and you can   #
# compare the two images. It looks like there is no difference,   #
# but in many cases the file size is reduced significantly ü•≥.    #
# Once the script is complete, you can commit the changes in your #
# local `moonbeam-docs` repo! And that's it!                      #
