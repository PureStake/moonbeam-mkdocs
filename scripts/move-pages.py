# ------------ üëã Welcome to the script for moving pages in the chinese repo ------------ #
# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - #
# The purpose of this script is to automatically update page(s) in the Chinese repo       #
# whenever page(s) are moved in the English repo. It only updates the location of the     #
# page, keeping the content in tact.                                                      #

# To use the script, ensure that the `moonbeam-docs` and `moonbeam-docs-cn` repos are     #
# nestled inside of the `moonbeam-mkdocs` repo. Then simply run the following command:    #
# `python scripts/compress-images.py <branch>` passing in the name of the branch with the #
# changes in the English repo, even if it's master, in your terminal. When the script is  #
# finished, the files without a match will be printed to your terminal. Just take some    #
# time to review those files. Then you can commit the changes in the `moonbeam-docs-cn`   #
# repo! That's it!                                                                        #
