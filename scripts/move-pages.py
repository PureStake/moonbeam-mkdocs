# The purpose of this script is to automatically update page(s) in the Chinese repo       #
# whenever page(s) are moved in the English repo. It only updates the location of the     #
# page, keeping the content in tact.                                                      #

# To use the script, ensure that the `moonbeam-docs` and `moonbeam-docs-cn` repos are     #
# nestled inside of the `moonbeam-mkdocs` repo. Then simply run the following command:    #
# `python scripts/compress-images.py` in your terminal. When the script is finished, the  #
# files without a match will be printed to your terminal. Just take some time to review   #
# those files. Then you can commit the changes in the `moonbeam-docs-cn` repo! That's it! #
