# The purpose of this script is to automatically update page(s) in the Chinese repo       #
# whenever page(s) are moved in the English repo. It updates the location of the page,    #
# any image paths that may have been changed, and any .pages files that need to be        #
# updated. It does so by comparing two commits and getting all of the changed files       #
# and sorting through them.                                                               #
# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - #
# To use the script, ensure that the `moonbeam-docs-cn` repo is nestled inside of the     #
#  `moonbeam-mkdocs` repo. Then simply run the following command:                         #
# `python scripts/move-pages.py <prev_commit> <latest_commit>` passing in the hash        #
#  of the two commits to compare. When the script is finished, the changes will be in the #
# `moonbeam-docs-cn` repo for you to review and commit them. That's it!                   #
