# ------------- üëã Welcome to the script for calculating redirect mappings ---------------#
# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - #
# The purpose of this script is to calculate redirect mappings for the `mkdocs.yml` file. #
# The script works by looking at the current file directory in the `master` branch and    #
# on your local branch. It compares the two file structures to see if content has been    #
# moved at all. If any content has been moved, the script will try to match the moved     #
# content and add it to the `redirect_maps` config in `mkdocs.yml`.                       #
# - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - #
# To use the script, ensure that the `moonbeam-docs` repo is nestled inside of the        #
#  `moonbeam-mkdocs` repo and on your branch with the latest changes. Then simply run     #
# `python scripts/calculate-redirects.py` in your terminal. There will be logs printed to #
# the terminal. Please read through them as they will guide you on which redirects need   #
# to be manually reviewed and any possible duplicates to be reviewed as well.             #
# The `mkdocs.yml` will automatically be updated, so just open that file to see the new   #
# redirects and make any updates!                                                         #
